you played it you played it to the beat. first when there\\'s nothing but a slow glowing dream that your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind  all alone i have cried silent tears full of pride in a world made of steel made of stone  well i hear the music close my eyes feel the rhythm wrap around take a hold of my heart  what a feeling being\\'s believing i can have it all now i\\'m dancing for my life take your passion and make it happen pictures come alive you can dance right through your life  now i hear the music close my eyes i am rhythm in a flash it takes hold of my heart  what a feeling being\\'s believing i can have it all now i\\'m dancing for my life take your passion and make it happen pictures come alive now i\\'m dancing through my life  what a feeling  what a feeling (i am music now) being\\'s believing (i am rhythm now) pictures come alive you can dance right through your life  what a feeling (i can really have it all) being\\'s believing (pictures come alive when i call) i can have it all (i can really have it all) have it all (pictures come alive when i call) (call call call call what a feeling) i can have it all (being\\'s believing) being\\'s believing (take your passion) now and then i think of when we were together like when you said you felt so happy you could die told myself that you were right for me but felt so lonely in your company but that was love and it\\'s an ache i still remember  you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness like resignation to the end always the end so when we found that we could not make sense well you said that we would still be friends but i\\'ll admit that i was glad that it was over  but you didn\\'t have to cut me off make out like it never happened and that we were nothing and i don\\'t even need your love but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough  no you didn\\'t have to stoop so low have your friends collect your records and then change your number i guess that i don\\'t need that though now you\\'re just somebody that i used to know  now you\\'re just somebody that i used to know now you\\'re just somebody that i used to know  now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over but had me believing it was always something that i\\'d done  but i don\\'t wanna live that way reading into every word you say you said that you could let it go and i wouldn\\'t catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know  but you didn\\'t have to cut me off make out like it never happened and that we were nothing and i don\\'t even need your love but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough  no you didn\\'t have to stoop so low have your friends collect your records and then change your number i guess that i don\\'t need that though now you\\'re just somebody that i used to know  somebody (i used to know) somebody (now you\\'re just somebody that i used to know) somebody (i used to know) somebody (now you\\'re just somebody that i used to know)  i
